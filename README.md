Ansible playbooks used to manage my home lab which consists of various Linux VMs running on Proxmox.

My general home lab [documentation is stored in the GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/plindstrom/home-lab/wiki) associated with this repo and is available for your reference in the off-chance it is helpful.
